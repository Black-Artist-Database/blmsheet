    <p>This site aims to provide an easy way to filter and sort the "1800+ Black Producers / Artists / Labels for Bandcamp Day" spreadsheet that has been shared. The sheet aims to support black artists, producers and labels through their bandcamp links.</p>
    <p>The data is a work in progress (non exhaustive) and administered by group of volunteers - any additions are very welcome via <a href="">this form</a>. Edits/feedback/comments can be e-mailed to to collectivedatavol@gmail.com. If you don't want to be on this sheet, we respect that, feel free to e-mail. Please only suggest Black producers / artists or Black owned labels. </p>
