        <h3 class="bad-subtitle">IN THE BEGINNING, HOW WE STARTED, OUR AIMS AND GOALS</h3>
        <p>Black Bandcamp is a community based platform and database, hosting over 2,800 international Black owned record labels, artists, producers and bands.</p>
        <p>This crowed-sourced database provides an easy way to sort through, filter and thus support Black artists worldwide via their Bandcamp profiles.</p>
        <p>The database is a continuous work-in-progress administered by a group of volunteers, committed to ensuring as many Black artists are admitted onto the website. (Disclaimer: We are not affiliated with Bandcamp).</p>
        <p>Starting as a spreadsheet by a group of likeminded music enthusiasts, Black Bandcamp was primarily formed to further leverage Black artists, labels and producers, in an accessible database format which could be added to and circulated.</p>
        <p>The two key socio-political factors that contributed to the initial creation of Black Bandcamp, were the Black Lives Matter movement and the global pandemic.</p>
        <p>Created on 4th June 2020, Black Bandcamp was formed as part of the global uprise in support of Black Lives Matter. With the murder of George Floyd and other Black folk globally, Black Bandcamp was created as a response to the structural mistreatment of Black folk in the (underground) electronic industry. In addition to this, the whitewashing and eurocentrism of the (underground) electronic industry, the culture in which this music is rooted - Black culture - had not been accredited to this marginalised community.</p>
        <p>The realisation of how unbalanced and corrupt the music industry is, was a thought heightened during the global pandemic, where a ‘reset’ and reflection had begun - with global inequalities being highlighted and actioned against. Whilst it should not have taken a global pandemic for action to be taken, the circumstances meant more momentum could be built; this momentum was key to the project growing to this point, becoming a widely embraced resource within the community.</p>
        <p>In addition to the Black Lives Matter movement and the global pandemic, Bandcamp Fridays were another factor spurring the creation of Black Bandcamp.</p>
        <p>With Bandcamp waiving their fees every first Friday of the month throughout 2020, this was a prime opportunity for people to directly support Black artists in a monetary sense. As we had been actively engaging with and utilising Bandcamp days to already directly support artists - at the time - it was the only available and functioning mechanism for supporting artists. The exposure of highly exploitative digital and streaming music platforms became ever more apparent, which further spurred us to create Black Bandcamp.</p>
        <p>By having such a wealth of Black artists on a centralised platform, it enables the Black voice to shine as a collective. By creating, maintaining, and publicising the database, the community surrounding Black Bandcamp is able to try and sidestep the structural inequity present in the music industry.</p>

        <h3 class="bad-subtitle">THE DATABASE.</h3>
        <p>The database is accessible in website form, and we are now moving to other mediums through which we can channel the project and the momentum it’s gathered. Through the database, we highlight the boundless range of Black musicality, as well as (in a more practical sense) fight against the structural inequalities resulting in lesser support for Black artists, by sidestepping some of the more traditional methods of generating visibility.</p>
        <p>Through this centralised database, we hope to give the power back to the community far and wide, whereby users submit artists, removing a layer of gatekeeping. In addition to this, the database can now be used for labels, bookers, promoters and programmers to diversify their communities and projects moving forward.</p>

        <h3 class="bad-subtitle">SELF DEFINITION.</h3>
        <p>With the definition and term ‘Black’ being relative to each individual’s geographical location, genetic make up and societal conceptualisation, we have a team who screen each and every submission to ensure that the space is preserved for Black artists. It’s important to note, we do not want to define what is Black for others, and encourage self-definition. Ask Raag to add their process of screening.</p>
        <p>This educational process has taught us the many different ways in which Black people identify with their race from each and every corner of the world. For those from the African continent, the term Black is not commonly used as a way of describing oneself. Being the majority race on the continent means that identifying oneself as Black is not necessary.</p>
        <p>On the African continent, racial labels do not have weight as there is a general and common understanding that everyone is the same - people celebrate their ethnicity and nationalities. What is key to note however, is that the matter of race still plays a part in our identity as a result of colonisation, as pre colonial systems work to undermine African’s.</p>
        <p>To ensure that we represent a full range of Black voices and protect and uplift those from further marginalised groups, we actively engage with a broad range of groups from within the Black global community. We seek out those that are less visible in the dance music industry, and we are consistent in airing our intentions and in reaching out to these communities. give a voice and platform to Black artists from alternative genres and backgrounds (not exclusively electronic music).</p>
        <p>We are committed to representing and collaborating with artists outside of the European and North American dance music sphere, by utilising our networks and ties from the African, Australiasian and South American continents. When possible we aim to collaborate with like minded organizations and institutions working to uplift marginalised creatives, for example: queer communities, the differently abled, the underprivileged; giving everyone in the Black underground music community a voice. One of the foundations we have for this action is having a diverse internal and core team and correspondents from varying parts of the world uniting under the same cause.</p>

        <h3 class="bad-subtitle">THE FUTURE.</h3>
        <p>We hope to leverage the platform that has been created to further service the community, and to strive towards the goals outlined above. Black Bandcamp was created in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic; to this end, the project so far has remained focused on the online space. In the future we hope to reach out to the physical space, with talks, parties and other celebratory events. Maintaining a presence in the physical sense is beneficial to the furthering of Black liberation, Black ownership and respect within the industry. Creating spaces where Black people can be comfortable, safe and enjoying themselves is a goal in its own right, but it also inspires newer generations of Black folk; serves to form networks; educates all folk on the origins of the music they so love.</p>
        <p>In the online space, we plan to continue to maintain, expand and promote the database, and work to ensure that those on it have a platform upon which they can showcase their art. To this end, the previews, editorial content, and special features will continue to be produced by our team, to highlight sections and individuals within the Black community.</p>
        <p>As Black Bandcamp grows and develops, we hope to further decentralise the overall structure, framework and basis of the community and platform, working towards a flatter set-up, free from gate-keepers.</p>

        <h3 class="bad-subtitle">THE TEAM.</h3>
        <p>The core team is made up of several Black team members based across different continents, with an additional 15 volunteer members worldwide. As a whole we represent a diverse cross section of the electronic music community, however we are always striving to take on points of view from other members of society; primarily, of course, from Black folk who we may not represent in some way. We are very aware of the fact that we cannot represent everyone; therefore, we try to regularly feedback with Black members of the community to ensure we are engaging with more voices; this process will be formalised in our new working structure.</p>
        <p>Within this structure, we hope to flatten the hierarchy of the project to ensure that there is no overarching influence within what we aim to do. Further to this, and fitting with our goal of creating Black networks within the electronic music space, we wish for the project not to be the only one of its kind - we wish to join and eventually form larger networks that have the same or similar goals of Black liberation, representation and ownership within the electronic music realm.</p>
        <p>We have a wider support team made up of electronic music lovers with key skill sets such as developers, administrators, database managers and other supporting roles.</p>

        <h3 class="bad-subtitle">CONTACTS, METHODS OF REDRESS AND ACCOUNTABILITY.</h3>
        <p>We aim to be as transparent as possible with our operations. Black Bandcamp believes in remaining 100% independent and Black-owned, and this belief is at the forefront when considering who we partner with and on what projects. We aim to only work with partners whose ethics are in line with ours, and who are actively working towards equality for Black people and other marginalised identities in the music industry.</p>
        <p>Every collaboration and partnership is deeply considered and questioned by our team and must meet our internal standards and criteria. The partner must also agree to our terms and conditions. Ultimately, our end goal is always to serve the wider Black community and dismantle structural inequity in the music industry.</p>
        <p>We understand the ideas and beliefs from Black people on how to achieve this common goal are not homogenous, and encourage our community to hold us accountable and raise any concerns, ideas and suggestions. We believe in growth and view Black Bandcamp as a community project where we are in constant communication with our community.</p>
        <p>If we have mishandled anything, we will address the issue directly with those involved and if required, address it publicly on our website and social media after having a team discussion and enacting a plan of resolution.</p>
        <p>If you would like to get in touch with any feedback or suggestions for Black Bandcamp, please contact us at community@email.com.</p>
